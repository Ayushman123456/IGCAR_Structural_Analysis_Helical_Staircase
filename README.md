# IGCAR_Structural_Analysis_Helical_Staircase
The code is used to analyze the Structure of a Helical Staircase according to Reynolds Designer Handbook
Development of computation program for Structural analysis of Helical staircase

Developed a code using C++ programing language to generate values for bending moments, torsional and shear forces of a helical staircase.
The code generates all values in tabular format in a .csv file with the help of file I/O functions such as fstream and ofstream.
The design is referred from Reynolds Designers Handbook. The resources referred include National Building Code(NBC)2016,India , IS 875 Part-1, IS 875 Part-2 , IS 456:2000,BS 5395 Part-2.
