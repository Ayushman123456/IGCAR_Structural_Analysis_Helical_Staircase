# IGCAR_Structural_Analysis_Helical_Staircase
The code is used to analyze the Structure of a Helical Staircase according to Reynolds Designer Handbook



Development of computation program for **Structural analysis of Helical staircase**

1.Developed a code using **C++** programing language to generate values for bending moments, torsional and shear forces of a helical staircase.
2.The code generates all values in tabular format in a .csv file with the help of **file I/O **functions such as fstream and ofstream.
3.Used **Web Plot Digitizer** to digitize the values of the graphs from the pdf file and make it readable by the code.
3.The design is referred from Reynolds Designers Handbook. The resources referred include National Building Code(NBC)2016,India , IS 875 Part-1, IS 875 Part-2 , IS   456:2000,BS 5395 Part-2.
