# IGCAR_Structural_Analysis_Helical_Staircase
The code is used to analyze the Structure of a Helical Staircase according to Reynolds Designer Handbook



Development of computation program for **Structural analysis of Helical staircase**

1.Collected all the design information from Reynolds Designer Handbook, IS 875, NBC 2016 and BS 5395 Part 2
2.Coded the design of the structural analysis of helical staircase using the C++ language.
3.Designed the code to read graphs from the images of the Reynolds handbook, which has been digitized using the Web Plot Digitizer.
4.Introduced the File I/O functions of C++ to display the results obtained and the helical staircase response due to dynamic loading in a .csv file.
